# Overview

Apply SOLID principles and best practices when editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones.

# Rules

- Favor clear, small functions with single responsibility.
- Avoid over-engineering; pick the simplest solution that meets requirements.
- Use best practices for readability: consistent naming, grouping, and structure.
- Optimize for performance with minimal code and DOM operations.
- Prefer composition and reuse instead of duplication.
