# Overview

Always follow the official AirConsole Quick Start documentation for initialization,
connection flow, and messaging between `screen.html` and `controller.html`.

# Rules

- Mirror the patterns in the Quick Start guide for:
  - Creating `new AirConsole()`
  - Setting `onReady`, `onConnect`, `onDisconnect`, and `onMessage`
  - Sending messages with `airconsole.message(...)` and `airconsole.broadcast(...)`
- Avoid assuming or hardcoding device IDs.
- Keep controller connection flow simple: connect, receive `joined`, then show UI.
- When unsure, consult and align with the Quick Start documentation:
